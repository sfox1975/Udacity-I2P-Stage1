# Udacity-I2P-Stage1
A website covering an aspect of my business, created as the Stage 1 project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to generate a website. More specifically, to generate the HTML and CSS code required to produce a functional website. I chose to make a site based on my work, which involves the buying and selling of options, which are publicly traded (like stock) financial instruments. I chose to focus on two risks of the options market, namely 'dividend risk' and 'trade bust risk'. Read more if you would like to learn about these risks.

## Additional Documents

1. index.html - the HTML code for the webpage.
2. style.css - the CSS code for the webage
3. images folder - this folder contains two images for the website, namely a chart showing a characteristic of Apple options (AAPL.png) and the logo for my company, Android Alpha Fund LLC (Logo.png)

## Usage

To view the website, do as follows:

1. Save the images folder, index.html and style.css files to the same directory
2. Open index.html with any web browser
